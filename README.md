# Lap1Proj

-The project involves creating an educational game for the Hive group of secondary schools to boost student engagement in non-STEM subjects. Small teams will develop a functional prototype, design wireframes, and present their solution. The game aims to address concerns from the Hive management, students, parents, and teachers about the lack of depth and enjoyment in the current curriculum, particularly in non-STEM areas.
