* Implementing character icon movement
```

    let newPosition = currentCell + 13;

    let newCell = document.getElementById(newPosition);
    if (newCell.classList.contains("w")) {
      newCell.appendChild(character);

      character.style.top = newCell.offsetTop + "px";
      character.style.left = newCell.offsetLeft + "px";
      if (newCell.classList.contains("checkpoint")) {
        fetchQuestions();
        modal.style.display = "block";
      }
    }
  }
```

### Challenges

* Initially getting movement of the character icon was tricky to implement/
* Checkpoint system


## Bugs
* Users can still move characters even with the modal question is shown
* Resizing browser screen, moves the character icon


## Future Features
* Allow users to choose a character icon from a list of options for gameplay.

* Introduce multiple maze levels, each increasing in difficulty.

* Incorporate a lives system, wherein users have three lives, and losing all three lives (by answering three questions incorrectly) requires them to restart the maze.

* Expand the range of history categories available to provide a broader selection of topics.

* Implement subcategories within each main category, offering more specific themes within the broader history topics (e.g., "Medieval Daily Life" as a sub category).

* Enable teachers to create custom categories and populate them with their own set of questions.

* Gradually increase the difficulty of questions as players progress through the maze, ensuring a suitable and challenging educational experience tailored for secondary school students.
